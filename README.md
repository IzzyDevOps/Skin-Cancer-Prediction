### Steps to Deploy the Model

1. Access the Google Colab Notebook

2. Open the Google Colab Notebook here.
Clone the Repository

* In the first cell of the Colab notebook, run the following command to clone the project repository:

`!git clone https://github.com/IzzyDevOps/Skin-Cancer-Prediction`
`%cd SkinCancerPrediction `

3. Install Dependencies 

* Install the required Python libraries by running:

` !pip install -r requirements.txt `

* Set Up Google Drive

* If you need to access additional data or save results, mount your Google Drive:

`from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')`

* Run the Model

4. Execute the entire Colab notebook to train and test the model:
   
* Click on "Runtime" â†’ "Run all" to run all cells sequentially.
  
* Follow the instructions in the notebook for model training and evaluation.
  
* View Results

5. After the notebook completes execution, check the results and model performance metrics in the Colab environment.
   
* Download or visualize the results directly from the Colab interface.
